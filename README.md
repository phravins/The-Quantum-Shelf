## Requirements

- The problem must be **original**
- Difficulty level: **Div1 / Div2**
- Must **not** be a known variation
- Model **Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507** (thinking disabled) must fail on **three plausible attempts**
- None of the failed attempts should pass **even a single test**
- Shared conversation links and failed code must be stored under `qwen/`
- The problem must be **search-proof**
- Avoid rephrasing existing problems

### Documentation Rules

- `idea.md` must include:
  - Initial concept
  - Rejected variants
  - Final formulation rationale
- `requirements.json` must specify limits:

```json
{ "time": 2, "space": 256 }
```

- Include **at least 5 strong test cases**
- `solution.md` must clearly explain:
  - Algorithm
  - Data structures
  - Complexity
- Folder structure **must exactly match** the specification
